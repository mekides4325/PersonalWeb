              The pandemic has altered people's lives in both enormous and small ways. <br>
              Covid-19 is a stark reminder of longstanding inequities in our societies, and how policies need to pay attention to protect and lift the least advantaged in society.
              <br>
              <h3> Be Prepared by Staying Informed About COVID-19</h3><br>

<ul>
    <h6>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h6>
<li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
<li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
<li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
<li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
<li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
<ul>
Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
<br><h4>Masks</h4>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and
 hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority
 <img src="./assets/image/mask.jpg"  width="100%">
 COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or
 possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Masks provide a simple barrier to help prevent these respiratory droplets from spreading in the air. You should wear a mask to protect others in case you have the virus, and you should wear a mask to protect yourself.
 <br><h4>wash your hands</h4>
 The single most important piece of advice health experts can give to help us stay safe from COVID-19 is this one: Wash your hands.

    <p><h3>I am Supper Proud To Be Ethiopian.</h3> just keep reading for the wonderful fact about Ethiopia<br>
        <br><h3> The oldest people in the world </h3><br>
        several archaeological findings in Ethiopia's afar region go quite some way in suggesting that the country may be where we all started out from.
        In 1972, Donald Johanson and Tim D. White discovered Lucy, <img src="./assets/image/lucy.jpg"  width="100%"> a 3.2 million year old hominid skeleten. For years, lucy was all the rage, embarking on 
        a nine-year worldwide tour and enjoying widespread fame. Then Ardi, also from the afar region but one million years her senior, rocked up and blew her out of the water.
       
        <br><h3> The First Cup Of Coffe </h3><br> 
        we all have got some to thank ethiopian earth and also old ethiopians  for the morning caffeine shot.
        <img src="./assets/image/coffe.jpg"  width="100%"> As the sory goes , a goat herder way back when noticed
        his flock's fondness for  a ceplirtain bush and decied to give one of the fruits a nibble himself. His day's herding was notaably more efficient for it-and the coffee industry took off from them.

        <br><h3>A nation of festivals </h3><br>
        Ethiopian is a country full of vibrant and colorful festivals. The biggest, Timket, is a three-day annual festival that honours the baptism of jesus
        christ in the river jordan. Today the priest remove the 'Tabots' from each<img src="./assets/image/timket.jpg"  width="100%"> church and march to the nearest water source, where the communal baptism
        takes place. The procession is accompainied by thousands of local dressed in dazzling white  traditional dress that contrasts with the colours of the 
        ceremonial robes and sequined velvet umbrellas of the priest.
